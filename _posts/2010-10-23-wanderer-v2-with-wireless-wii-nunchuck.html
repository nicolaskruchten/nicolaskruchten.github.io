<br />
<p>After building my little <a href="http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2010/10/arduino-wanderer/">autonomous wanderer robot</a>, I saw this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRlQTBPtYfc">iPad-controlled blimp</a> and went ahead and added iPad control to my robot too. I had a Python script on my iMac which took commands from the iPad over Wifi and relayed them to the Arduino using XBee. I demo'ed this at <a href="http://www.bitnorth.com/2010/">BitNorth 2010</a>, but I'm not sure if the video is up yet. That said, the fact that all the commands were relayed through a 'base station' bothered me, and I saw a cheap wireless Wii Nunchuk which I immediately bought, thinking I could make it into a really ergonomic remote control for my little robot. I probably could have gotten a Wifi shield instead, but I was up for a different kind of challenge.

<p>The Wii Nunchuck (wired or wireless) communicates using the I2C protocol, which the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire">Arduino supports</a> quite nicely. There exists a cheap little hardware <a href="http://todbot.com/blog/2008/02/18/wiichuck-wii-nunchuck-adapter-available/">Arduino/Nunchuck interface</a> but I had no use for the little white casing around the receiver that's supposed to plug into the WiiMote so I cracked it open and interfaced the little circuit board inside directly to my Arduino. After a lot of experimentation and reading of <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1259091426">forum posts</a> and <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers#Nyko_Kama">wikis</a>, I found a magic incantation of bytes to send to my particular Nunchuck that would enable me to pull data from it reliably, and I packaged it up into a little <a href="http://github.com/nicolaskruchten/arduino/tree/46345beb49a7aad07aa8913778d446678ba7da82/libraries/WiiChuck">object-oriented Nunchuck library here</a>. While I was at it, I also packaged up my <a href="http://github.com/nicolaskruchten/arduino/tree/46345beb49a7aad07aa8913778d446678ba7da82/libraries/PololuMotorController">Pololu motor controller interface code</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/nicolaskruchten/arduino/blob/46345beb49a7aad07aa8913778d446678ba7da82/wiichuckControlledIRAvoidingLibrary/wiichuckControlledIRAvoidingLibrary.pde">robot code sketch</a> itself is on GitHub as well.</p>
<p>So after all this hardware and software work, I have remote-controllable wanderer robot! In the video above you can see that it's capable of autonomous and controlled modes. I used the joystick to control motion, the C button to stop and the Z button to turn on autonomous mode. It's pretty convenient to have a remote for a bot like this, so I can bring it back if it wanders underneath the bed, or turn it around if it gets stuck in a corner or something.</p>

<p>For reference, and because I want to try out my syntax highlighter plugin, here is the  initialization code that works for my 'Intec' wireless Wii Nunchuck (look in GitHub at how I handle retrying after failing initialization):</p>
