<p>So I finally got around to working on my <a href="http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2010/12/silvia-mod-plan">Silvia Mod Plan</a>, getting all the way to Step 5! The video above is a demo of the setup I have to show a real-time graph on my iPad of the boiler temperature in the Silvia.</p>
<p>Having installed the thermocouple in the Silvia and played with my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tc4-shield/">TC4 shield</a>, my initial plan was to use the Arduino to transmit data to my iMac using <a href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-wired-embedded-solutions/zigbee-rf-modules/zigbee-mesh-module/xbee-zb-module.jsp#overview">XBee</a> as a wireless serial link, where I would run a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> process which would read data from the USB port and which would communicate with the iPad via a WebSocket over Wifi (phew, mouthful!). Ideally the Arduino would speak Wifi but in the meantime I figured I'd play with this setup. I chose NodeJS because it seemed really easy to set up <a href="http://socket.io/">WebSockets using socket.io</a>, and that seemed like a good way to feed data to <a href="http://smoothiecharts.org/">Smoothie Charts</a> for real-time graphing. I rewrote the code in <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>, because it's the best way to write NodeJS code IMO (a discovery I made after writing the first version of this code 4 months ago) and because it's so fitting for this project!</p>

<p>The first snag I ran into was the fact that there doesn't seem to be a good way to read from a USB port from Node, and it felt too much like my day-job to write an add-on in C++ to do it, so I had to work around. My solution was to run a separate Python process which would read data from the USB port and would POST to the NodeJS web server whenever the Arduino sent a temperature reading.</p>
<p>The second snag I ran into was the fact that the XBee didn't seem to be able to transmit all the way to my iMac, so I hung the XBee from my laptop, located halfway between the iMac and the Silvia and ran the Python script there, POSTing over Wifi to the iMac. Then I smartened up and installed the NodeJS process on my laptop. So really, this system is just a convoluted way of doing what could have been done using a USB cable to graph data on my laptop, but bouncing signals around over multiple protocols, machines and wireless technologies is so much more fun!</p>
<p>The code is, of course, up on Github: <a href="https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/coffeegraph">https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/coffeegraph</a></p>
