At Datacratic we tend to worship, like Etsy (and AppNexus!), at the Church of Graphs. We've even started using Statsd, the system they've released to collect stats and relay them to Carbon for display in Graphite. And by display, I mean display on a dashboard visible to the entire dev team at the office, as seen above!
