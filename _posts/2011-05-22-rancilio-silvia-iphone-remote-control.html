<p>This is a screenshot of what I pull up on my iPhone every morning now after its alarm clock wakes me up. That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s an interface to turn on my espresso machine so that it will warm up to a specific temperature by the time I&#8217;m done snoozing! I can even look at a real-time plot of the temperature to confirm that it&#8217;s holding where it should be and doesn&#8217;t need to bumped up or down a degree.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>As outlined in <a href="http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2010/12/silvia-mod-plan/">this previous post where I laid out my plan</a>, I wanted the extra precision of digital temperature control in my Silvia, but I didn&#8217;t want to slap a PID box on the side of it with an LED readout of the temperature. So I decided to build my own controller, and I opted to add Wifi to it for a web-based interface, which also opened up the possibility of turning it on remotely from bed, so it would be all warmed up by the time I was ready for my morning shot of espresso. Additionally, the controller automatically shuts off 1 hour after first being activated, so I essentially leave my Silvia powered up all the time, and the boiler only turns on when I ask it to.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>For the temperature control, I contacted the guy behind <a href="http://www.pidkits.com/" target="_blank">PIDKits.com</a> and asked for everything except a PID controller, and he obliged, and also sold me a pre-assembled <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tc4-shield/" target="_blank">TC4v1 Arduino shield</a> to interface with both the thermocouple (to read the boiler temperature) and the solid-state relay (to control the temperature). So with a bit of assembly, it was pretty easy to essentially bypass the built-in themostat with a digital one running on my Arduino. I played around with the P, I and D parameters on the controller, and I was able to get the temperature to be stable within ±1°C; much better than the ±15°C that the stock thermostat can achieve!</p>
<p>Next I ordered a <a href="http://www.cutedigi.com/product_info.php?products_id=4564" target="_blank">CuHead Wifi shield</a> for my Arduino and built a very simple REST-like interface using WiServer, which returns JSON, to run on the controller itself. This essentially turns the controller into a web service, which is in turned controller by a very simple PHP-based web app that runs on my iMac . This app contains all the right magical HTML incantations to look like a slick app on an iPhone/iPad, and can also be used on my iMac directly and even my new Kindle 3! (<em>Update Jan 2012</em>: I now have an HTML5 cached app on the phone: no iMac required after the first load!)</p>
<p>The whole thing is right now tucked away on the shelf beneath my Silvia, totally invisible to the casual eye, but I&#8217;ll probably put it in a little box or something just to hide exposed wires. (<em>Update Jan 2012</em>: in order to keep the connection stable I actually ended up hanging the controller on the wall hidden behind the Silvia.)</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t quite implement everything in the original plan, and I haven&#8217;t yet been able to run the entire app directly on the controller, nor have I been able to set up WebSockets through the Wifi shield, but overall I managed to accomplish the original design goals with a minimum of fuss, and hey, I use this thing every morning to make great espresso, so I&#8217;m a happy camper!</p>
