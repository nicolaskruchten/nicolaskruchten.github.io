This is the machine-readable back of my new nerdy QR-code business card!

<!-- more -->

When you scan it with a QR-code reader app on an iOS or Android device, the QR-code decodes to the following text, which is valid vCard, and is therefore added to your contacts. Try it!

    BEGIN:VCARD
    VERSION:2.1

    FN:Nicolas Kruchten, Eng
    TITLE:Head of Product Engineering

    END:VCARD

And of course, there is a human-readable front:
