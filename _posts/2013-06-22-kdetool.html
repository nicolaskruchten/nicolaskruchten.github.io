<p> In 2005, I was contracted to create a program to support research into the application of a statistical technique called Kernel Density Estimation to the study of global poverty. The result of this contract (which I worked on with my friend and occasional colleague David de Koning) is the Kernel Density Estimation and Analysis tool which I have just released on Github under an open-source license.</p>
<p>The research (which, to be clear, wasn't done by me) resulted in a very interesting paper called <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=991503">Kernel Density Estimation Based on Grouped Data: The Case of Poverty Assessment</a>.</p>
