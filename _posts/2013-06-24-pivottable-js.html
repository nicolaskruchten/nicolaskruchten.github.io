<p>When I wear my data-scientist hat, one of the tools I reach for most often is a Pivot Table. When I wanted to build a web-based tool that included a pivot table, I didn&#8217;t find any Javascript implementations that made sense or didn&#8217;t have crazy assumptions built-in, so I rolled my own in CoffeeScript, as a jQuery plugin.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable">It&#8217;s now up on GitHub</a> under a BSD license with <a href="http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable">a nice demo</a>. I hope people find it useful!</p>
<p><span id="more-632"></span>If you work with data and you don&#8217;t know what a pivot table is, I encourage you to learn about them, because they are very useful for quick&#8217;n'dirty data analysis. My web-based implementation is a decent learning tool but there are other, much-better implementations, such as in Microsoft Excel (although since Office 2003 they&#8217;ve made some changes that were not for the better) and AquaDataStudio.</p>
<p>I posted this on Hacker News and got some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5937047">nice comments</a>!</p>
