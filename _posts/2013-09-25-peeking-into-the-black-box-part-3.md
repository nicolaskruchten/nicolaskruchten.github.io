In this post, I show that in order to maximize the economic surplus over a whole campaign, the quantity you should look at on an auction-by-auction basis to decide when to bid is actually the expected return on investment (ROI) rather than the expected surplus. At Datacratic, we actually switched to an ROI-based strategy about a year ago but I didnâ€™t get a chance to follow up with a blog post until now.
