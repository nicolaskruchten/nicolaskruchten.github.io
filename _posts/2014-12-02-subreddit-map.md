For part of [my presentation at Montreal Python][pres], I made an interactive map of the various sub-sections of the website Reddit (called subreddits). You can take a look at the [interactive version][iv] or see a static annotated one above. The interactive one includes basic info on how I made it and full details are in the presentation. I got some nice comments in the [/r/DataIsBeautiful subreddit post][re]
