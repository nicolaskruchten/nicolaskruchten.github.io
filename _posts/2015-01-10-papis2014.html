<p>At this conference, I ran into Misha Bilenko, who told me that this then-unnamed approach was commonly-used and frequently-reinvented in the AdTech industry and that he really should write it up. He then went on to name it "Distributed Robust Algorithm for Count-based Learning" or DRACuLa for short (in 2015). Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sZeTxIrnxs">a nice video where he sums it up</a>.</p>
