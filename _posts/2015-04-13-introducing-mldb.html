<p>I recently did the first ever public demo of the product I'm working on at <a href="http://datacratic.com">Datacratic</a>: the <a href="http://mldb.ai">Machine Learning Database</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>MLDB is a new kind of database, one that is specifically designed for operationalizing machine learning. You install it wherever you want and send it commands over a RESTful API to store and explore data, train machine learning models on that data, and then expose those models as APIs.</p>
