<p>I went back to my alma mater at the University of Toronto to give a talk at <a href="http://www.pycon.ca/" target="_blank">PyCon Canada</a> how to make <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter</a> even more magical than it already is with cell magic extensions.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>You can find the Jupyter Notebook I used for the talk <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicolaskruchten/pyconca/blob/master/jupyter_magic.ipynb" target="_blank">on NBViewer</a> or on Github along with the other resources at the link below.</p>
