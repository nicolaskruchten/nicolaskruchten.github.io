<p>I was recently invited to give a talk about auction theory and online advertising at Concordia University for a course entitled <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~c691_4/" target="_blank">Social and Information Networks</a>, which uses a really interesting textbook called <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/" target="_blank">Networks, Crowds, and Markets</a>.</p>
