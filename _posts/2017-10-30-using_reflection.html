<p>My friend Mark Weiss recently started a podcast called <a href="http://www.usingreflection.com/">Using Reflection</a> and I was pleased to be <a href="http://www.usingreflection.com/Nicolas_Kruchten_-_Telling_True_Stories_with_Data/#b33481cb">interviewed as a guest on his 6th episode</a>. We had a great chat about datavis and engineering ethics, among other topics.</p>
