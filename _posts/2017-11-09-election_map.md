The [2017 edition of my interactive map of Montreal election results](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/mtlelection2017bysection) is now available, and I'm so pleased about the results it shows! In 2013 I made a map a couple of months after the election and it was considered so unusual it was talked about on the radio. But times have changed: this time [the data](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/elections-2017-resultats-detailles) was available within days, and within hours of that, news outlets had [similar](http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/1227999/le-vote-municipal-au-coin-de-rue-pres/) [maps](http://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/17-11_resultats-municipales-montreal/index.html) on their websites. I still like mine better though because it shows data from all 103 races, rather than just the mayoralty. The [2013 map](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/mtlelection2013bysection/) is still around, for reference.
