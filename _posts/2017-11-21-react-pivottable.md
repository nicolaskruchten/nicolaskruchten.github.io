[Pivot tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) are interactive data exploration and summarization tools which have been a critical part of data analysts’ toolkits for the past 25 years, especially in spreadsheets like Excel. Five years ago I built [PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/), which has since become one of the most popular Javascript pivot table implementations. I initially wrote it in CoffeeScript and packaged it up as a jQuery plugin, but the front-end world has evolved a lot since then so today I’m excited to announce a new-and-improved version of PivotTable.js for the modern web: [react-pivottable](https://react-pivottable.js.org/).
