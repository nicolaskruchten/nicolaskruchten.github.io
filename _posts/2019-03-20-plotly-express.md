[Plotly Express](https://plotly.express) is a new high-level Python visualization library: itâ€™s a wrapper for [Plotly.py](https://plot.ly/python) that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts. Inspired by Seaborn and ggplot2, it was specifically designed to have a terse, consistent and easy-to-learn API: with just a single import, you can make richly interactive plots in just a single function call, including faceting, maps, animations, and trendlines. It comes with on-board datasets, color scales and themes, and just like Plotly.py, Plotly Express is totally free: with its permissive open-source MIT license, you can use it however you like (yes, even in commercial products!). Best of all, Plotly Express is fully compatible with the rest of Plotly ecosystem: use it in your [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) apps, export your figures to almost any file format using Orca, or edit them in a GUI with the JupyterLab Chart Editor!
