<p>I recently gave a talk about <a href="https://plotly.express/">Plotly Express</a> and <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/"> Dash</a> at <a href="https://montrealpython.org/en/">Montreal Python</a>. The description of the talk was, "You start the morning exploring some data in a Jupyter notebook with Plotly Express and after lunch you whip up a web application to give your non-programmer colleagues access to those same insights with Dash, all in under a 100 lines of Python, no Javascript required. This talk will show you how Plotly's open-source libraries fit together to make this possible."</p>
