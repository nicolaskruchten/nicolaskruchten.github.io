I gave [a talk at Montreal Python](https://www.meetup.com/Montreal-Python/events/282404834/) where I showed a diagram I've been working on to capture and explain how the various pieces of the [Python data visualization landscape](https://pyviz.org/) fit together. My presentation is first, starting about 7 minutes into the video.
