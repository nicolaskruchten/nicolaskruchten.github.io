[IEEE VIS 2022](https://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome) was last week in Oklahoma City and I was really happy to have been able to attend in person. The very-earnest motto of the conference was *"VIS â€™22 is about the people you meet"* and for me at least, it really was! I'll note that my strategy of writing [a blog post describing my research and interests](https://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2022/10/notascope-in-progress/) and tweeting it ahead of time and posting it to the Discord really helped with meeting people, so I will definitely be doing that again. That said, the personal connections I made aren't that interesting to read about, so here is my list of highlights from the conference content. If you prefer a longer recap with more photos, [Tamara Munzner's traditional epic yearly VIS twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tamaramunzner/status/1581653531680919554) is also available.

## Sunday

I attended the [Visualization for Data Science (VDS)](http://www.visualdatascience.org/2022/) workshop in the morning and really enjoyed the closing keynote by [Remco Chang](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) which described an interesting idea for a [Grammar of Hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14267) which might in the future be used to describe what types of a questions can be answered by a given data set or visualization or asked by an analyst, in the hopes of matching them up.

I sat in on the [Workshop on Visualization for the Digital Humanities (Vis4DH)](https://vis4dh.dbvis.de/) in the afternoon and liked the keynote by [Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com/) about the differences in approach to "data" between humanists and scientists. I won't paraphrase it badly here but some key differences included the idea that replication is not a goal in the humanities as it is in the sciences, and that humanists often seek to question/challenge existing categorizations rather than use/reuse them. "Uncertainty" is often about the idea of the category or its appropriateness, rather than numerical uncertainty about how much of something.

## Monday

The keynote for the [Workshop on evaluation and BEyond - methodoLogIcal approaches for Visualization (BELIV)](https://beliv-workshop.github.io/) (if you can "believe" that acronym!) by [Casey Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/) really made me think about the ethics of using data in academic or other work in a deeper way than before, and I like to think I've read and thought about this a lot already.

The closing panel of the [VisInPractice workshop](https://twitter.com/visinpractice) was on Integrating Research and Products and I appreciated the comments of [Richard Brath](https://richardbrath.wordpress.com/) from [Uncharted](https://uncharted.software/) about how visualizations that really work for experts often seem to contravene strongly-held beliefs researchers have about "the right way" to do visualization, like using charts with 2 (or more! gasp!) y-axes.

## Tuesday

This was the opening day for the conference proper and there were a lot of [awards for best papers](https://ieeevis.org/year/2022/info/awards/best-paper-awards) and papers that had stood the test of time and career awards etc.  Richard Brath wrote [a nice piece about the opening keynote and its relationship to the closing one](https://richardbrath.wordpress.com/2022/10/22/vis2022-and-the-under-explored-realms-of-text-vis/).

The paper that stood out to me the most was [Affective Learning Objectives for Communicative Visualizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04078.pdf) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrW92ubvSdo)), which frames some aspects of vis that are less-often researched in a really nice way.

## Wednesday

This was the first of two days with four paper sessions each. The first session was the one that most specifically overlapped with my interests: **Transforming Tabular Data and Grammars**. There were some super-charged pivot tables presented, such as [HiTailor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05821) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrSju2-lqCc)) but the [Animated Vega-Lite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03869) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe3Foy2h3ag)) and [No Grammar to Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07998) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTqeZ4nKpk)) papers were what really got me fired up. I loved the expert-interview evaluation of Animated Vega-Lite and how they were able to add really composable/low-viscosity animation abstractions into Vega-Lite. No Grammar to Rule Them All made so many good points and framed things so nicely I was nodding along the whole time I was reading it.

During the **Understanding and Modeling How People Respond to Visualizations** session, a handy [Survey of Perception-Based Visualization Studies by Task](https://usfdatavisualization.github.io/VisPerceptionSurvey/) was presented, which I'll likely be referring back to as a resource.

The Short Papers session on **Visualization Systems and Graph Visualization** included our [paper on VegaFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06631) but I also enjoyed hearing about the NL4Vis (Natural Language for Visualization) improvements in the [Facilitating Conversational Interaction in Natural Language Interfaces for Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00189?context=cs) paper. I also of course really enjoyed seeing the [Plotly-Resampler](https://predict-idlab.github.io/plotly-resampler/) being presented at VIS.

The final session of the day before the amazing banquet at the First Americans Museum was about **Uncertainty**. The paper that stuck with me from that session (and really the whole conference) was the striking [Dispersion vs Disparity: Hiding Variability Can Encourage Stereotyping When Visualizing Social Outcomes](https://3iap.com/dispersion-disparity-equity-centered-data-visualization-research-project-Wi-58RCVQNSz6ypjoIoqOQ/) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qak_QLRIiqQ)) which shines a light on a visualization pitfall I hadn't thought of before but now can't unsee.

## Thursday

During the **Interactive Dimensionality (High Dimensional Data)** session, I was a little puzzled by some of the papers on "steering" embeddings but [VERTIGo: A Visual Platform for Querying and Exploring Large Multilayer Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9382912) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMsaPw3_tgE)) seemed like a solid UI for querying multilayer graphs.

At the **Graphs and Networks** session, I really liked the presentation on [Taurus: Towards A Unified Force Representation and Universal Solver for Graph Layout](http://www.yunhaiwang.net/vis2022/Taurus/Taurus.pdf) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU4edAM92P8)), which seemed to really neatly unify a bunch of algorithms into one equation, then proposes a new algo based on that equation, and then proposes a single efficient way to solve it. [Visualizing Graph Neural Networks with CorGIE: Corresponding a Graph to Its Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12839) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcUKFNtc-Yw)) also looks like a clever way of understanding Graph Neural Networks, and I loved the idea of mapping a CIELAB a/b slice to the x/y coordinates of an embedding so as to provide a consistent node color across views!

During the **Reflecting on the Field** session, the paper [Visualization Design Practices in a Crisis: Behind the Scenes with COVID-19 Dashboard Creators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12829) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAIVmmIm2KI)) talked about COVID dashboards as "boundary objects" which were the site of negotiations between many parties during a crisis, and reminded me of [the video I made by stringing together 470 static official Quebec dashboards](https://twitter.com/nicolaskruchten/status/1557004148436000768) and which made me wonder about the design decisions that drove them.

The final session I attended on Thursday was on **Provenance and Guidance** and I thought that the [Medley: Intent-based Recommendations to Support Dashboard Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03175) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeGU7bncXes)) and [GEViTRec: Data Reconnaissance Through Recommendation Using a Domain-Specific Visualization Prevalence Design Space](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11975) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko4ZBpBfFVk)) papers were nice, complementary approaches to semi-automated dashboard creation.

## Friday

There was only one paper session before the capstone address and closing, on **Comparisons**. The [View Composition Algebra for Ad Hoc Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07836) ([preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8tQ3WzDeBE)) is a simple yet powerful concept based on the idea of comparison as a basic interaction.

The capstone by [Kerry Magruder](https://www.ou.edu/cas/hsci/people/faculty/kerry-magruder) on Thinking Visually and Galileo's Telescopic Discoveries was just wonderful. Edward Tufte talks about Galileo's books in his work, but this was a much more in-depth exploration of this topic. There's [a video here of what seems to be a related or almost identical talk](https://vimeo.com/groups/750547/videos/760681165). Apparently there was a tour of the History of Science library at Oklahoma University the night before where some folks got to see these manuscripts but I didn't realize it was happening until after.

## Coda

I didn't attend the [alt.VIS workshop](https://altvis.github.io/) but looking at this blog post, the paper entitled [* (Name Of This Paper Can Be Automatically Generated)](https://altvis.github.io/papers/2022/auto-name.pdf) presented there is pretty spot-on!
