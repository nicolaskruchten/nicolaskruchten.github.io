I love the way Apple names things: FireWire, App Nap, iPhone, iPod, EarPod, AirPod, AirPlay, FairPlay etc.
It's playful and there's a lot of reuse of words and sounds. Having just finished reading the biography of
Steve Jobs, I decided to visualize various Apple product and feature names as a network to see this reuse in action.
Check out the [interactive version here](https://nicolas.kruchten.com/appleTM/) (it works best on a desktop). I got
the names from [Apple's public list of trademarks](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html).
