[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is an artificial intelligence technique for getting computers to automatically program themselves to perform certain tasks. I studied this in my undergraduate years in the context of [Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system) and worked extensively with these techniques during my time at Datacratic.
